# Arduino-Based Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge

I built **three** low-cost rain gauges using:
- A reed switch sensor
- Magnetic tipping bucket mechanism
- Arduino Uno

The system counts the number of bucket tips to calculate rainfall.

## Features
- Reed switch interrupts
- Tipping count logic
- Calibration for rainfall mm per tip
- Real-time data logging
- Deployment photos from Mkwinda
